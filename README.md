🧟 DoomsdayAI
First-person web-based game built with Three.js and Vite.

Welcome to the team! This project is set up with strict professional standards (Husky + Commitlint) to ensure our code history stays clean. Follow the steps below to get your environment ready.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Prerequisites

2. Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/purvaspatel/doomsdayAI.git

3. Run the Development Server
Start the game locally:

The game will be running at http://localhost:5173.

🛠 Project Standards (Important!)
We use Conventional Commits. This means every commit message must follow a specific format, or it will be blocked by a git hook.

Commit Message Format:
type: description

Common types:

feat: A new feature (e.g., feat: add player movement)

fix: A bug fix (e.g., fix: resolve jumping glitch)

chore: Maintenance tasks (e.g., chore: update readme)

refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature

If your commit is blocked, check your spelling and ensure you have a space after the colon!
